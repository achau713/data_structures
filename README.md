# Implementation of Binary Search Tree Data Structure in Python

The script contains a class for creating nodes and for constructing a BST. Also, the script contains common functions implemented with a BST. All main functions use a helper function to call the main function. For example, the function insert calls insertNode, which performs the intended behavior

More functions will be added later.

Here are the current functions:

1. setRoot
2. insertNode
3. searchNode
4. deleteNode
5. findMin
6. findMax

Code up to the searchNode function is from/inspired by jakemmarsh:

Code is extended with comments and more functions
